                photograph or photo. Photography became popular in the middle
                19th century with Daguerreotype.Photographers must have superior
                technical skills. They must be proficient in using cameras and
                have a good understanding of studio and exterior lighting. They
                must also be adept at using photo-editing software to complete
                post-production work.Becoming a photographer can give you an
                entirely new perspective on everyday life. You can use
                photography to turn almost anything you find beautiful into a
                work of art. You can use your photographic skills to creatively
                capture an array of subjects that ranges from children's
                emotions to family gatherings.
